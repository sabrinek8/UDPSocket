# UDP  Server-Client Example

This repository contains a simple implementation of a UDP server and client in Java. The server listens on port 1250 and, upon receiving a UDP datagram, responds with the current date and time. The client sends an empty datagram to the server and prints the received date and time.


## Notes

- Make sure that the server is running before starting the client.
- Update the server address in the `UDPClient` code if the server is not running on the same machine.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
